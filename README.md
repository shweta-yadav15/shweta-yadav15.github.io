# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my portfolio website, https://shweta-yadav15.github.io/ The original html, css, and php were acquired from a free Colorlib theme found <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/template/personal/">here</a>. It was a lot of fun tweaking the HTML to make the template my own. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS in the process of making this site.

The website showcases my past experiences, projects, skills acquired and my journey so far.
